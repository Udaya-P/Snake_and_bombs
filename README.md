# Snakes and Bombs

**Snakes and Bombs** is a twist on the classic snake game where players must navigate their snake to eat food while avoiding bombs. Every time the snake eats food, the score increases by +10 points. However, hitting a bomb will decrease the score by -10 points. The game ends if the snake hits the walls or itself.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay**: Navigate the snake using arrow keys to eat food and grow longer.
- **Bombs**: Bombs randomly appear on the board, and hitting them will decrease your score.
- **Score System**: Gain +10 points for every food consumed and lose -10 points for every bomb hit.
- **Game Over Conditions**: The game ends if the snake hits the walls or its own body.

## How to Play
